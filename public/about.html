<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Renuka, and I'm a Student. Let me tell you a few things about myself. I am passionate about swimming. I love the feeling of being in the 
  water, and I enjoy the challenge of pushing myself to improve. I also believe that swimming is a great way to stay healthy and fit. In addition to 
  swimming, I'm also passionate about web development. I recently started learning how to code, and I'm finding it to be a lot of fun. I love the 
  creativity and problem-solving involved in building websites. I'm always excited for new ways to learn and grow.

<p>Also, I love to bake. I enjoy the process of creating delicious treats that I can share with others. I'm also interested in the science behind baking, and 
  I'm always experimenting with new recipes and techniques. I believe that baking is a great way to express creativity and bring my loved ones 
  together.

<p>Finally, I am incredibly grateful for the love and support of my family and god. They are my biggest cheerleaders and my strongest support 
  system.They are my source of strength and inspiration. I know that I can always count on them, no matter what.
